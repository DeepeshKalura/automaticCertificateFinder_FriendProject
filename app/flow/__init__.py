# Best case sernerio
# convert folder_link into the id 
# --> then check is folder_id exit in a database or not 
    # --> if yes then check the user exit in the database or not 
        # --> if yes then we will going to get the url of the pdf file and we will download it and show the user

# Optimization case sernerio
# -->  in case that folder_id exit in a database but not the user then what we will going to do.

# Worst case sernerio
# convert folder_link into the id
#   --> then check folder_id exit in a database or not
#   --> if no then we will go the folder check every link that that present in the folder 
#   --> can user ocr or multimodel to check it and stored every value in the database so we can get the best case senario
#   --> if no we does not got the user name of the show user that we does not find your certificate.

# Optimized Worst case sernerio
# It is the advance feature where we uses binary search rather than linear search to find the user name in the pdf file.


# Extra things which we have to do is :-
# Protection from dns with machine learning
# Cap protection for the drive api
